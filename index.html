                    <h3>Macaron Craze!</h3>
                    <p>"They are the perfect little indulgence," Trujillo explains. They are also one of the few desserts that are, in their original form, gluten-free. The classic macaron recipe involves almond flour, egg, sugar, airâ€¦and, save for (optional) additional flavorings, very little else. ("Macaron," "macaroon," and "macaroni" all come from the same root, the Italian maccherone, or "fine paste"; the macaron is named for the nut flour that gives the cookie what little heft it has.) </p>

                    <h3>Cupcakes or Cake?</h3>
                    <p>Year on year, people keep asking about the difference between cupcake and cake. Both cupcake and cake are highly loved delicacies around the world. And both are available in different flavours and designs. Cake has always been the staple desserts for occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries and is also being used as a surprise by many. On the other hand, cupcakes are becoming more and more popular for casual treats and little sweet hunger pangs.</p>
